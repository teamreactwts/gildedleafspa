          Dr. Mitchell Schwartz founded Procell Therapies in 2013 with a bold
          vision. During his 30+ years as a practicing dermatologist he had
          observed the limitations and damage caused by other anti-aging
          systems. Dr. Schwartz realized that with some engineering and
          ingenuity he could provide better results in a safe and non-invasive
          way. Thanks to our roots in dermatology practice, we know what it
          takes to successfully adopt a new treatment technology. Thatâ€™s why
          Procell Therapies provides trainings, marketing materials, and a
          lifetime guarantee for all of our products.
